<h2>Chapter 1: All you need to know about Me!</h2>
<p>Hello!and welcome to my website, my name is Yvonne I am 13 years old,
and im about to be in eight grade!, my favorite color is yellow and my
favorite food is french fries. I have 2 cats and 2 dogs, my mom is a
teacher and my father is a stay at home dad. my sister is about to be 
in tenth grade and we go to the same school, her name is Zyrah, 
she is 15 years old and her favorite  color is  blue, while my mom's
is green and my dad's is violet.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2:  My Hobbies</h2>
<p>I really like drawing, ever since I was little I have been drawing
with my sister. I also really like reading, it cures my boredom and
and its very calming, I only read fantasy books though, but I have 
non-fictional ones before but it really wasn't my type.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3:  The person I  look up to</h2>
<p>Its very obvious but, I look up to my mom, not because shes my mom
but because shes very kind, brave, patient, caring, and loving, and 
because of that alot of people also look up to her and respect her, I 
wish to be like her someday when I grow up.</p>

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4: My Dreams</h2>
<p>When I grow up, I wanna be an independant business woman, but 
before that happens im going to study really hard and try to get
the highest grade in my department from eight grade to grade 12 
and hopefully get a scholar to a really good university and try 
to be cumlaude. And then im going to get a really good job that 
pays well and soon I will be able to buy my dream house and car, 
and im also going to buy my parents a really nice house to repay 
everything they did for me and make them proud. And one thing I 
also want to be is a famous professional artist.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5:What I would do when im successful</h2>
<p>I would travel around the world and try different foods
from the different countries I will go to, but before that
I will learn how to speak in their languages so I wont get
lost or have any troubles. And I will also visit the popular
spots in the country, and over all just have some fun while 
im there.</p>
